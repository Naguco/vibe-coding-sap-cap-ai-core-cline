1.

Generate a CAP Application for a bookstore. There are different modules. The CAP application should provide different services with different authorizations each one. The services are the following ones:
 - A service for the administrator of the bookshop. The administrator can perform any CRUD operation against the DB, but with the proper considerations
 - A service for the end user to interact with the books available in the bookshop. The possible interactions are: Buy, Review, and leave a comment. Also, the user should be able to return books, so it is also needed a history of invoices, and also the possibility to interact with that history, so the en user can return a book.

Also, it should have a UI. The idea is to adapt to the proper concepts of the bookshop to the Fiori developmet guidelines. For example when displaying a book, this should be an object page.

Please, generate the memory bank, so we can start with the project.

2. Now, let's start writing the backend with CAP. So, firstly, let's start the project, don't do nothing more. With cds init should be enough. I will take care of reviewing the status of the initialization.

3. Now, let's start creating the models for our data. So, let's go with the second phase.

4. For this new phase, phase 3, we are going to focus on the creation of the admin service. Remember, TDD approach, so we can ensure that everything compiles and it is ready for commiting and deploying. So, let's create some tests. Remember, it should be possible to the admin to:
 - Create, Delete, Update, Read Books.
 - Same for Authors.
 - Same for categories.
 - Regarding orders, the admin should manage them. He should be able to update the status.
 - Same for returns.

5. Now, let's create the customer service implementation. The information stored in the progress section looks good, so let's continue.

6. As you have already seen, it would also be interesting to have some kind of discount system in our backend CAP application. With this in mind, let's follow a plan.
    - I can think about the admins creating the discount codes. These discounts will be, as of now (maybe in the future it will change), being applied in the total amount of the order.
    - Then, the end users will take advantage of these discounts.
        - I don't want the users to see by front end the discount, it is ALWAYS the responsibility of the backend to determine the last value of the order. So, maybe we can think about a function that returns the final amount so the UI can show it.
        - We will need to validate the status of the discount code.
        - Apply the discount to the order.
    - Consider the CAP documentation before moving one with the new enhancement.
    - Apply a TDD approach. There are tests already done in this project. Maybe it will be great to modify them and include more tests FIRSTLY. I want a RED-GREEN-REFACTOR approach.
    - Let's discuss also about the new enhancement.

7. It seems that there is a bug in the code. The administrator explained that when they create a book, it is possible to create it with a negative amount. It seems that this is not happening when updating the book. Could you please check it? If you see a bug, please, perform solving this task in a TDD way. Red, green way. Firstly the test, check that it does not pass, then the bug fixing.
