## What's Left to Build

### Priority 1: Customer Discount Application (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Core Business Functions**
   - `calculateOrderTotal` function to apply discounts to cart
   - `validateDiscountCode` function to check code validity
   - Enhanced `purchaseBooks` action to accept discount codes

2. **Business Logic Requirements**
   - Percentage discount calculation with max discount cap
   - Fixed amount discount application
   - Minimum order amount validation
   - Usage limit tracking and enforcement
   - Date range validation (validFrom/validTo)

3. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write failing tests for discount application scenarios
   - Implement functions to make tests pass
   - Refactor for clean, maintainable code

### Priority 2: UI Integration
1. **Admin UI Enhancement**
   - Add discount code management interface
   - Configure list reports and object pages for discounts
   - Implement activate/deactivate actions

2. **Customer UI Enhancement**
   - Add discount code input field to checkout flow
   - Display discount calculation breakdown
   - Show applied discount in order confirmation

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
1. **Analytics and Reporting**
   - Discount usage analytics
   - Sales performance with discount impact
   - Customer behavior insights

2. **Advanced Discount Features**
   - Category-specific discounts
   - User-specific discount codes
   - Bulk discount operations

## Critical Issues Resolved
- âœ… **SQL Syntax Error**: Fixed query syntax using proper CAP CQN patterns (`discountId.ID`)
- âœ… **Breaking Schema Changes**: Updated both AdminService and CustomerService order creation
- âœ… **NOT NULL Constraints**: Ensured all order creation includes `originalAmount` and `discountAmount`
- âœ… **Test Suite Compatibility**: Updated existing tests to work with new order schema

## Technical Implementation Details

### Discount System Architecture
- **DiscountCodes Entity**: Comprehensive discount code management
- **Order Extensions**: Tracks original amount, discount applied, and final total
- **Admin Service**: Full administrative control over discount codes
- **Customer Service**: Discount application during purchase (pending implementation)

### Data Validation Requirements
- Discount codes validated for active status, date range, minimum order amount, usage limits
- Percentage discounts respect maximum discount caps
- Fixed amount discounts cannot exceed order total
- Usage counters updated only after successful order creation

### Business Logic Rules
- **Admin Management**: Create, update, activate/deactivate discount codes
- **Customer Application**: Validate codes, calculate discounts, apply to orders
- **Usage Tracking**: Increment usage counter, enforce limits
- **Error Handling**: Clear, user-friendly error messages

## Key Metrics and Achievements

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of critical paths covered for admin functionality
- **Code Organization**: Clean separation between admin and customer concerns
- **Security Implementation**: Comprehensive authorization model maintained
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and transaction handling

### Business Logic Completeness
- **Order Management**: Complete order lifecycle with discount tracking
- **Inventory Control**: Real-time stock tracking maintained
- **Discount Administration**: Full admin control over discount system
- **Customer Experience**: Foundation ready for discount application

## Next Steps for Customer Discount Implementation

### Functions to Implement (customer-service.js)
```javascript
// Function: Calculate Order Total with Discount
this.on('calculateOrderTotal', async (req) => {
  // Input: { items: [...], discountCode?: string }
  // Output: { originalAmount, discountAmount, totalAmount, isValidDiscount }
});

// Function: Validate Discount Code
this.on('validateDiscountCode', async (req) => {
  // Input: { discountCode: string, orderTotal: number }
  // Output: validation result with discount info
});

// Enhanced purchaseBooks action:
// - Accept optional discountCode parameter
// - Use calculateOrderTotal function
// - Update discount usage counter
// - Link applied discount to order
```

### Tests to Write (test/customer-service.test.js)
```javascript
describe('Discount Application', () => {
  // calculateOrderTotal tests (with/without discount, different types)
  // validateDiscountCode tests (active/inactive, expired, usage limits)
  // Enhanced purchaseBooks tests (with valid/invalid discount codes)
});
```

## Next Session Priorities
1. **TDD Implementation**: Write failing tests for customer discount functions
2. **Business Logic**: Implement calculateOrderTotal and validateDiscountCode
3. **Purchase Enhancement**: Update purchaseBooks to handle discount codes
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate complete discount workflow
5. **UI Enhancement**: Add discount code input to purchase flow

This represents a solid foundation with the admin side of the discount system complete and well-tested, ready for customer-facing implementation.
