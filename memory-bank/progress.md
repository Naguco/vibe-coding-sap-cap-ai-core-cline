# Project Progress

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Shopping Cart Issues Fixed

### Recently Completed Work

#### Shopping Cart Functionality - All Issues Resolved
- **✅ FIXED: Clear Cart "Unknown bound action" Error**
  - Root cause: Service definition had bound actions properly defined but authorization was blocking calls
  - Solution: Fixed authorization annotation for `MyShoppingCartItems` from `cart.createdBy = $user` to `createdBy = $user`
  - Location: `srv/customer-service.cds` line 184

- **✅ FIXED: All Bound Action Tests**
  - Updated all bound action test URLs to match the correct OData format
  - Examples:
    - `updateCartItem`: `/odata/v4/customer/MyShoppingCartItems(${cartItemId})/updateCartItem`
    - `clearCart`: `/odata/v4/customer/MyShoppingCart(${cartId})/clearCart`
    - `addToCart`: `/odata/v4/customer/Books(${bookId})/addToCart`

- **✅ FIXED: Floating-Point Precision Issue**
  - Test was failing due to JavaScript floating-point precision (99.94999999999999 vs 99.95)
  - Solution: Applied same rounding logic in test as service uses: `Math.round(expectedTotal * 100) / 100`
  - Location: `test/customer-service.test.js` line 1183

#### Technical Details Fixed
1. **Authorization Issue**: The navigation path `cart.createdBy = $user` in CDS authorization was not resolving correctly during bound action calls, causing 403 Forbidden errors
2. **Test Implementation**: All bound action tests now use correct OData URL patterns for entity-bound actions
3. **Precision Handling**: Service implementation properly rounds currency amounts to 2 decimal places, tests now match this behavior

### Current Test Status
- **All Tests Passing**: 116/116 tests pass
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Fully tested and working
- **Authorization**: Proper user isolation implemented and tested

## What Works Now

### Shopping Cart System ✅
- **Cart Management**: Users can create, view, and manage their shopping carts
- **Item Operations**: Add, update, remove, and clear cart items
- **Bound Actions**: All entity-bound actions working correctly
  - `Books.addToCart()` - Add books to cart
  - `MyShoppingCartItems.updateCartItem()` - Update item quantities
  - `MyShoppingCartItems.removeFromCart()` - Remove items
  - `MyShoppingCart.clearCart()` - Clear entire cart
  - `MyShoppingCart.getCartSummary()` - Get detailed cart summary
  - `MyShoppingCart.purchaseFromCart()` - Purchase all cart items
- **Virtual Fields**: Automatic calculation of totals, subtotals, item counts
- **User Isolation**: Each user only sees their own cart data
- **Authorization**: Proper access control with customer role restrictions

### Purchase System ✅
- **Direct Purchase**: `purchaseBooks` action for immediate checkout
- **Cart Purchase**: `purchaseFromCart` action for cart-based checkout
- **Discount Integration**: Both purchase methods support discount codes
- **Stock Management**: Automatic stock updates after purchases
- **Order Generation**: Creates proper order records with unique order numbers

### Discount System ✅
- **Code Validation**: `validateDiscountCode` checks validity, dates, usage limits
- **Total Calculation**: `calculateOrderTotal` applies discounts correctly
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatic increment of discount usage counters
- **Multiple Types**: Supports both percentage and fixed-amount discounts
- **Constraints**: Respects minimum order amounts and maximum discount caps

### Customer Service Features ✅
- **Catalog Access**: Read-only access to books, authors, categories
- **Order Management**: View order history, order items
- **Review System**: Submit and manage book reviews
- **Return Requests**: Request returns for delivered orders
- **Recommendations**: Personalized book recommendations
- **Security**: All customer data properly isolated by user

## Architecture Patterns Established

### Authorization Strategy
- Service-level authentication with `@requires: 'customer'`
- Entity-level authorization with `@restrict` and user-based filtering
- Bound actions inherit entity-level authorization
- Before handlers for additional user context filtering

### Data Modeling
- Customer-specific projections (`MyOrders`, `MyShoppingCart`, etc.)
- Virtual fields for calculated values (`totalAmount`, `subtotal`)
- Proper entity relationships with redirected associations

### Testing Approach
- Comprehensive test coverage for all actions and entities
- Mock authentication with different user contexts
- Error scenario testing with proper status code validation
- Floating-point precision handling for currency calculations

## Next Steps

The shopping cart system is now fully functional and tested. All originally reported issues have been resolved:

1. ✅ "Clear cart" unknown bound action error - FIXED
2. ✅ 403 Forbidden errors on cart operations - FIXED  
3. ✅ Test failures due to precision issues - FIXED

The system is ready for production use with comprehensive test coverage.
