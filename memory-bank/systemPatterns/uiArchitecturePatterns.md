## UI Architecture Patterns

### Fiori Elements Integration
```
Customer App Structure:
├── BookCatalog (List Report)
├── BookDetails (Object Page)
├── MyPurchases (List Report)
├── PurchaseHistory (Object Page)
└── ReturnProcess (Form/Workflow)

Admin App Structure:
├── BookManagement (List Report + Object Page)
├── OrderManagement (List Report + Object Page)
├── CustomerManagement (List Report + Object Page)
├── Analytics Dashboard (Analytical List Page)
└── InventoryTracking (List Report)
```

### Navigation Patterns
- **Semantic Object-Based**: Books → BookDetails → Reviews
- **Cross-App Navigation**: From Customer to Admin context (role-dependent)
- **Deep Linking**: Direct access to specific books/orders via URL
