#### Previously Completed Work - Cart UI Issues Resolution

#### Shopping Cart Button Functionality - All Issues Fixed ✅

**Issue 1: Clear Cart Button Not Working**
- **Problem**: Clear cart action executed successfully but UI didn't refresh automatically
- **Root Cause**: Missing `@Common.SideEffects` annotation to trigger UI refresh
- **Solution**: Added `@Common.SideEffects` annotation to `clearCart` action in `srv/customer-service.cds`
- **Files Modified**: `srv/customer-service.cds`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue 2: Remove From Cart Button Error - "Unknown bound action"**
- **Problem**: `removeFromCart` action failing with "Cart item not found" error (404)
- **Root Cause**: Two critical issues:
  - Parameter index wrong: using `req.params[0].ID` instead of `req.params[1].ID` 
  - Authorization logic incorrect: checking `cartItem.createdBy` instead of `cartItem.cart_createdBy`
- **URL Structure**: Actions called via nested path `/MyShoppingCart(cartId)/items(cartItemId)/action`
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed parameter access to use `req.params[1].ID` for cart item ID from nested URL
  - Updated authorization to check cart ownership through relationship: `cartItem.cart_createdBy !== user`
  - Applied same fixes to both `removeFromCart` and `updateCartItem` actions
- **Files Modified**: `srv/customer-service.js` lines 446-485
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue 3: Update Cart Item Quantity Not Working**
- **Problem**: Same parameter index and authorization issues as remove from cart
- **Solution**: Applied identical fixes to `updateCartItem` action
- **Files Modified**: `srv/customer-service.js` lines 395-445
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue 4: Get Cart Summary Not Displaying Results**
- **Problem**: Action executed successfully but nothing displayed in UI
- **Root Cause**: Fiori Elements doesn't automatically display complex return structures or string results from actions
- **Final Solution**: 
  - Used `req.info(summaryText)` to display detailed cart summary as information message popup
  - Changed return type from complex object to `{ success: Boolean; message: String }`
  - Service now shows rich cart details including items, quantities, prices, and totals in popup message
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `srv/customer-service.js` lines 487-530 (implementation)
  - `srv/customer-service.cds` lines 76-79 (return type)
  - `test/customer-service.test.js` (updated tests)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue 5: View Cart Navigation Enhancement**
- **Problem**: Users had to navigate through cart list to see their single active cart
- **User Request**: Direct navigation to cart details since users can only have one active cart
- **Solution**: Enhanced `ViewCartAction.js` to provide seamless navigation to cart
- **Files Modified**: `app/customer-shopping-ui/webapp/ext/ViewCartAction.js`
- **Status**: ✅ ENHANCED

#### Test Suite Updates ✅
- **Updated Cart Action Tests**: All test URLs updated to match nested URL structure
- **Parameter Structure**: Tests now use `/MyShoppingCart(cartId)/items(cartItemId)/CustomerService.action` format  
- **Return Type Updates**: All `getCartSummary` tests updated to expect `{ success, message }` structure
- **Files Modified**: `test/customer-service.test.js` (cart action test sections)
- **Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING
