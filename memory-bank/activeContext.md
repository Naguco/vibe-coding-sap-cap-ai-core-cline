### UI Structure
```
customer-shopping-ui/
├── webapp/
│   ├── manifest.json          # App configuration with CustomerService binding
│   ├── Component.js           # UI5 component definition
│   ├── index.html            # Application entry point
│   └── i18n/
│       └── i18n.properties   # Internationalization texts
└── annotations.cds           # UI annotations for Fiori Elements
```

### Service Binding
- **Connected to**: `/odata/v4/customer/` (CustomerService)
- **Entities Used**: Books, Authors, Categories, MyReviews
- **Authentication**: Mocked authentication with customer1 user

### UI Annotations Configured
```cds
// List Report Configuration
UI.LineItem: [title, author.name, price, stock, publisher, language]
UI.SelectionFields: [title, author_ID, publisher, language]

// Object Page Configuration
UI.HeaderInfo: Book title with author and image
UI.Facets: 
  - Book Information (details)
  - Customer Reviews (related reviews)
UI.FieldGroup#CustomerGroup: All book properties display
```

## Previous Work - Discount System (COMPLETED ✅)

### Discount Functionality Implementation
All discount functionality has been successfully implemented and tested:

#### Core Business Functions ✅
- **validateDiscountCode Action**: Complete validation with business logic
- **calculateOrderTotal Action**: Order calculations with discount application  
- **Enhanced purchaseBooks Action**: Integrated discount code support

#### Key Technical Learning
**Service Communication Pattern**: Internal action calls must use `this.send()`:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT CAP pattern
const result = await this.send('validateDiscountCode', { discountCode, orderTotal });
```

## Current Application Architecture

### Service Layer
- **AdminService**: Complete CRUD for all entities, discount management
- **CustomerService**: Customer-focused operations, discount application

### UI Layer  
- **bookstore-app-ai-ui**: Admin interface (temporarily disabled annotations)
- **customer-shopping-ui**: Customer shopping interface ✅ ACTIVE

### Data Model
- **Core Entities**: Books, Authors, Categories, Orders, OrderItems, Reviews, Returns
- **Discount System**: DiscountCodes with comprehensive validation
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign keys and associations

## Immediate Next Steps (Enhancement Priorities)

### 1. Shopping Cart Functionality (High Priority)
```javascript
// Add to CustomerService:
// - Cart entity for session management
// - addToCart, removeFromCart, getCart actions
// - Cart persistence and retrieval
```

### 2. Checkout Process (High Priority)
```javascript
// Enhance customer-shopping-ui:
// - Cart summary page
// - Discount code input field
// - Order confirmation flow
// - Integration with existing purchaseBooks action
```

### 3. User Authentication (Medium Priority)
```
// Replace mocked auth with:
// - XSUAA/IAS integration
// - User context in services
// - Role-based access control
```

### 4. UI Enhancements (Medium Priority)
```
// Add to customer interface:
// - Wishlist functionality
// - Advanced search and filtering
// - Product recommendations
// - Review submission capability
```

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Dual UI Approach**: Separate admin and customer interfaces for optimal UX
- **Fiori Elements**: Rapid development with standard SAP patterns
- **Service Separation**: Clear boundaries between admin and customer operations
- **Annotation Isolation**: Separate annotation files to avoid conflicts

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Customer-First Design**: Optimized for shopping experience vs. admin efficiency
- **Mobile Responsive**: Equal experience across all device types
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, modern interface following Fiori guidelines
- **Search-Driven**: Easy product discovery with multiple filter options

## Current Development Environment
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/I569759/Documents/Presentations/Vibe Coding CAP/Demo/bookstore-app-ai`
- **Server Running**: `cds watch` on localhost:4004
- **Authentication**: Mocked auth (customer1 user for customer UI)
- **Applications Available**:
  - Customer Shopping: `http://localhost:4004/customershoppingui/index.html`
  - Admin Interface: `http://localhost:4004/bookstoreappaiui/index.html`
